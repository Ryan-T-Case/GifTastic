# GifTastic - NFL Edition

## Description

* **GifTastic - NFL Edition**
GifTastic - NFL Edition is an app developed using Giphy's API, along with Bootstrap for styling, and JavaScript and jQuery for the logic and DOM manipulation.

* **How Does GifTastic - NFL Edition Work**
When the app has loaded completely, 8 buttons with the names of NFL players will generate on the screen. Each time the user clicks on a button, 10 gifs will render on the screen based on the topic listed on the button. The gifs are intially still versions but can be toggled between still and animated states when clicked on. The app has a form that will take user input and dynamically add another button of the user's choice so that more gifs can be queried on the page. All gifs are obtained using an AJAX GET method to obtain properties of the objects in the Giphy API.

* **Target Audience of GifTastic - NFL Edition**
The target audience of this app is anyone who is a fan of the NFL and is lookin for entertaining gifs of their favorite players. 

* **Purpose of the Project**
The purpose of this project was to practice API and AJAX concepts learned in Week 6 of the University of Richmond's Coding Bootcamp.
